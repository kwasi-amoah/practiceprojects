# practiceprojects
I recently started my transition into the tech space as a data scientist.
This repo contains all my completed beginner projects detailing what I have been able to learn so far.
My training started off with learning how to navigate spreadhseets, and then I moved on to databases, specifically MYSQL.
This was followed by data visualisation and storytelling in Power BI.
